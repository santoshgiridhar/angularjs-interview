        The image shows a complex gradient background. It was done in Photoshop, please recreate it with HTML and webkit's CSS3. <br>You should not use any images, just CSS3. It should work in Chrome and Safari. You should use as minimum markup as possible. <br>Try to make it as visually close to the reference image as you can. As markup create a single div without content: div id="gradient"
